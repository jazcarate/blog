My name is Joaquin Azcarate.

I usually go by _Florius_ on the interwebz.

This blog is intended for a place where I can dump things I find interesting. Whatever they may be.

I'm a programmer currently living in Barcelona, Spain ðŸ‡ªðŸ‡¸.

With over 5 years of software development experience in various projects. From big <abbr title="telecommunications company">telco</abbr> to small startups, and many things in between.

I've also taught maths and programming. Was a mentor for new recruits, and a big part of the recruiting technical evaluations.

I enjoy functional programming, emojis, using tools in ways they were not intended, and language syntax. Only one of which is remotely useful.

Fear~~less~~ful skater ðŸ›¹.

Cat-daddy of two.
