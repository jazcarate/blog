title: Why Do I Write?

    I have much room for improvement where it comes to communicating. A tool I think can help me with it is writing a blog entry every so often about things I care about. This blog is just that. A training ground. My training ground.

In my worldview, programming is much more about **transmission of knowledge** than remembering how to invert[^invert] a binary tree.
I think it is paramount for programmers of this day and age to be competent in:
 1. Communicating their ideas clearly and concisely.
 1. Using existing abstractions, or creating ones if the need arises[^not]. Abstractions entail vocabulary.
 1. Writing documentation, decisions, and tradeoffs that are selected. Both for posterity's sake and as a way to decant what was and was not important at that time.

I _suck_ at these three. But that's ok because I can work on improving 😊.

## Communicating Ideas

I have a lot of experiences where I have an idea for which I can't put words. I imagine blobs, arrows, and boxes of how things need to interact. But when I want to communicate them I usually ramble on, fail to draw what I have in my head, and by and large, those concepts are communicated imperfectly. Or not at all.

Communication **is hard**.

But I think that the ability to communicate is a skill that can be worked on. Improved upon. It needs time and practice. This blog is my training ground.
I don't expect most of the posts here to be life-changing. But I hope that at some point I will have a groundbreaking idea that I'll want to share. If/when that time comes, I would like to be prepared. So I train, here.

## Existing Abstractions

Writing also forces me to do some research, and expand my vocabulary (and therefore my pool of abstractions). Every new entry I explore existing material. See what others have written about it. And I'm often presented with like-minded individuals with far more experience in the subject matter, that have interesting choices of terminology.

I've had some ideas I wanted to explore but quickly found other resources that covered all that I wanted to explore, and then some. And even if I didn't end up writing an entry, my knowledge did expand.

I would love to be that _resource_ for someone else; that might be struggling to find the words for a problem, or get some guidance on a topic. Even if they disagree entirely on what I had to say, at least I can be a bad example.

## For Posterity's Sake

Finally and most purposeless for you, the reader, it is a way I can log my journey through life. I look forward to coming back to some old entry and think: “Oh, how naïve young Joaco was”.
And if **you** are me, in the future, then remember: you left a pair of socks in the top left drawer in the kitchen 🧦.

[^invert]: Why would anyone, in any domain, need to _invert_ a tree‽‽
[^not]: More often than not, abstractions over "new" ideas already exist. It is just too hard to find them in the _heat of the moment_. We need some time to work on a particular problem that we start to see patterns and similarities the _new_ abstractions have with existing ones.
