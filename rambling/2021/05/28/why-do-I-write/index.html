  <blockquote>
  <p>Why does this blog exist? Is it worth the carbon footprint to compile, host and serve this blog?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In my worldview, programming is much more about <strong>transmission of knowledge</strong> than remembering how to invert<sup id="fnref:invert" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:invert" class="footnote" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> a binary tree.
I think it is paramount for programmers of this day and age to be competent in:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Communicating their ideas clearly and concisely.</li>
  <li>Using existing abstractions, or creating ones if the need arises<sup id="fnref:not" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:not" class="footnote" rel="footnote">2</a></sup>. Abstractions entail vocabulary.</li>
  <li>Writing documentation, decisions, and tradeoffs that are selected. Both for posterity‚Äôs sake and as a way to decant what was and was not important at that time.</li>
</ol>

<p>I <em>suck</em> at these three. But that‚Äôs ok because I can work on improving üòä.</p>

<h2 id="communicating-ideas">Communicating Ideas</h2>

<p>I have a lot of experiences where I have an idea for which I can‚Äôt put words. I imagine blobs, arrows, and boxes of how things need to interact. But when I want to communicate them I usually ramble on, fail to draw what I have in my head, and by and large, those concepts are communicated imperfectly. Or not at all.</p>

<p>Communication <strong>is hard</strong>.</p>

<p>But I think that the ability to communicate is a skill that can be worked on. Improved upon. It needs time and practice. This blog is my training ground.
I don‚Äôt expect most of the posts here to be life-changing. But I hope that at some point I will have a groundbreaking idea that I‚Äôll want to share. If/when that time comes, I would like to be prepared. So I train, here.</p>

<h2 id="existing-abstractions">Existing Abstractions</h2>

<p>Writing also forces me to do some research, and expand my vocabulary (and therefore my pool of abstractions). Every new entry I explore existing material. See what others have written about it. And I‚Äôm often presented with like-minded individuals with far more experience in the subject matter, that have interesting choices of terminology.</p>

<p>I‚Äôve had some ideas I wanted to explore but quickly found other resources that covered all that I wanted to explore, and then some. And even if I didn‚Äôt end up writing an entry, my knowledge did expand.</p>

<p>I would love to be that <em>resource</em> for someone else; that might be struggling to find the words for a problem, or get some guidance on a topic. Even if they disagree entirely on what I had to say, at least I can be a bad example.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>‚ÄúI‚Äôm not totally useless. I can be used as a bad example.‚Äù
‚Äï Victor Hugo, Les Mis√©rables</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="for-posteritys-sake">For Posterity‚Äôs Sake</h2>

<p>Finally and most purposeless for you, the reader, it is a way I can log my journey through life. I look forward to coming back to some old entry and think: ‚ÄúOh, how na√Øve young Joaco was‚Äù.
And if <strong>you</strong> are me, in the future, then remember: you left a pair of socks in the top left drawer in the kitchen üß¶.</p>

    </li>
    <li id="fn:not" role="doc-endnote">
      <p>More often than not, abstractions over ‚Äúnew‚Äù ideas already exist. It is just too hard to find them in the <em>heat of the moment</em>. We need some time to work on a particular problem that we start to see patterns and similarities the <em>new</em> abstractions have with existing ones.¬†<a href="#fnref:not" class="reversefootnote" role="doc-backlink">&#8617;</a></p>

    </a>
    <p class="post-summary">
      One of the tools judges employ to thwart attempts to cheat is to require players to write down what cards they will be playing within a particular tournament, and routinely check them. Judges must perform these checks the fastest way possible to not delay the tournament. As such, they developed a myriad of techniques. I feel we under-use the availability of the decklist, so having a clear plan ahead of actually getting the deck in our hands can prove highly effective. In this post, I would like to explore some techniques' inner workings. Propose a hypothesis on why they might work in some situations but not others. Consider unexplored alternatives. And build a heuristic on what method is better for each circumstance. Join me!

      Durante mucho de mi jueceo, tuve este conflicto interno de cu√°ndo intervenir en un partido de Magic, o si siquiera hacerlo! Una persona mucho m√°s inteligente que yo una vez me dijo: Si alguna vez no sabes algo, escrib√≠ un post al respecto. As√≠ que aqu√≠ estoy.  La respuesta a la pregunta de si ¬øDebo intervenir?, como muchas otras respuestas en la vida es ‚Äúdepende‚Äù.
